#Compendium of Heroes

#Warning! for the time being code will be refactored unsparingly. When this reaches an alpha release we will stick to naming conventions etc.

This is an app we are making for our third year project in the Bachelor of Information Technology at Southern Institute of Technology, New Zealand.
The group working on this is called "Real Standard Studios"
We aim to have a working replacement for all paper and books used by the average player in the [pathfinder RPG](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/) by the end of 2014 with the ability to have RPG rule systems moved in and out as data modules

#Future Goals
- Link players with each other using bluetooth or similar wireless technology
- Let data be pushed to GM for combat stats
  - Dice rolls are sent to the GM to remove the ability to lie about dice roll outcome
- Gms can create battlemaps for combats
- Players can join in on the battlemap with the generated mobs for combat using a token or small sprite
- Gms can generate mobs for combats and other misc npcs
  - Have a drop down menu which asks for size of creature, colour for distinction and optional picture if you want
- Small chat system to allow players to message each other, notifications to the GM that X player and Y player are whispering to each other and the ability to watch the conversation
- Let players message the GM to allow for actions to be kept secret from the party
- An android tablet version
  - Let Game masters schedule games and have these games pushed to users google calendars

Targeting Android version 4.0.3 (API version 15) and higher, this allows us to use more modern features and reach 78.6 of all android users.
